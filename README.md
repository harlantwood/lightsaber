Lightsaber  [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/harlantwood/lightsaber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/harlantwood/lightsaber)
==========

A lightweight jedi utility toolbelt, written in coffeescript.

This is a small collection of utilites I have written for my personal use; I am sharing in case they are useful for others.

I have not written docs, but I have captured some of how I have used the library in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/harlantwood/0e6fc35abba5a6ae8491).

To use the [node package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lightsaber):

    npm install lightsaber
